Hi, I'm Saloni :)

Currently, I'm juggling a bunch of different roles.

- I'm a researcher at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org), where I write about global health. 
- I'm a founding editor of [Works in Progress](https://worksinprogress.co), where I recruit and work with authors for our quarterly magazine. 

Occasionally, I write about various science topics for online magazines.

I have a [Substack newsletter](https://salonium.substack.com) where I write about great new scientific research using charts, maps and statistics.

I recently completed my PhD at The University of Hong Kong and King's College London, where my thesis focused on how differences in study design can influence research findings in the field of psychiatric genetics.

You can get in touch with me by email at saloni@ourworldindata.org, on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/salonium) where my DMs are open, or on <a rel="me" href="https://fediscience.org/@salonium">Mastodon</a>.
