Hi, I'm Saloni :)

- I'm a researcher at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org), where I work on all things global health. 
- I'm also a founding editor of [Works in Progress](https://worksinprogress.co), where I recruit and work with authors for our quarterly magazine. 

Occasionally, I write about various science topics for online magazines.

I have a [Substack newsletter](https://salonium.substack.com) to keep you updated with great new scientific research.

I recently completed my PhD at The University of Hong Kong and King's College London, where my thesis focused on how differences in study design can influence research findings in the field of psychiatric genetics.

You can get in touch with me by email at saloni@ourworldindata.org, on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/salonium).
