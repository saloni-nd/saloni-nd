Hi, I'm Saloni :)
 
- I'm a co-founder and editor at [Works in Progress](https://worksinprogress.co), where I commission new articles on science and global health, lead data visualization, and write articles.
- I write a blog called [Scientific Discovery](https://www.scientificdiscovery.dev).
- I co-host a podcast called Hard Drugs.

I have a [repository](https://github.com/saloni-nd/scientific-discovery) to share data and code for charts I create for my blog.

Previously, I was a researcher at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org) on global health. I did my PhD at The University of Hong Kong and King's College London, where my thesis focused on how differences in study design can influence research findings in the field of psychiatric genetics.

You can get in touch with me by email at saloni@scientificdiscovery.dev, or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/salonium).
