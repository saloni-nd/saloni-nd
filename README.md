Hi, I'm Saloni :)

Currently, I'm juggling a bunch of different roles.

- I'm a researcher at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org), where I write about health research. 
- I'm a founding editor of [Works in Progress](https://worksinprogress.co), where I recruit and work with authors for our quarterly magazine. 
- I'm an editor at [Stripe Press](https://press.stripe.com), where I recruit and work with authors to write books. 

Occasionally, I write about various science topics for online magazines.

I'm also finishing my PhD at the University of Hong Kong and King's College London, where my thesis focuses on how differences in study design influence research findings in the field of psychiatric genetics.

You can get in touch with me at saloni@ourworldindata.org or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/salonium) where my DMs are open.
