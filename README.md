Hi, I'm Saloni :)

- I'm a researcher at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org), where I work on all things global health. 
- I'm also a founding editor of [Works in Progress](https://worksinprogress.co), where I do data visualization and work with authors for our quarterly magazine.
- I write a blog called [Scientific Discovery](https://www.scientificdiscovery.dev).

I have a [repository](https://github.com/saloni-nd/scientific-discovery) to share data and code for charts I create for my blog.

I recently completed my PhD at The University of Hong Kong and King's College London, where my thesis focused on how differences in study design can influence research findings in the field of psychiatric genetics.

You can get in touch with me by email at saloni@scientificdiscovery.dev, or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/salonium).
